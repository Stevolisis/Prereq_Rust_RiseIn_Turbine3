# Prerequisites: PreReq Rust Program from Turbine3

## Overview
These prerequisites are meant to assess your ability to follow processes, execute tasks, debug
simple errors (intentionally placed), and ship code. They are not a test of your typescript or
coding skills.

- **Program Derived Addresses (PDA)**: PDAs allow us to sign transactions with a Public Key derived from a deterministic seed, providing additional security.
- **Interface Definition Language (IDL)**: The IDL is a JSON file that defines the public interface for interacting with the program. It contains account structures, instructions, and error codes for Solana programs.
